node-deployer
=============

Deployer is a deployment tool for Node.js The whole tool is designed to be
simple and sane in its function and its defaults.

Deployment Defaults
-------------------

The command line utility parses your projects package.json to establish its
defaults. Only three options are necessary to get fully automated deployments.
Simply add a block like the following in your project's package.json:

  {
    "deployment": {
      "host": "server.example.org",
      "user": "deploy",
      "repo": "git://example.org:example/app.git",
      "path": "/var/sites"
    }
  }
  
Whatever you specify in the deployer block will be used as the defaults for
the deploy command.

Overriding Defaults
-------------------

You can override the defaults provided in your package.json using these
options with the deploy command:

  -H, --host     Host to deploy to
  -U, --user     User to deploy with
  -R, --repo     Repository to deploy from
